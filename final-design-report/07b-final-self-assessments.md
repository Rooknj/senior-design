My individual contributions for project Virtuoso included many technical and non-technical aspects. Technically, I contributed architecture considerations and discussion towards each of the microservices during the design of the project to ensure our microservice strategy was well-planned before implementation. I also contributed code towards several of the microservices in various languages (ex: Python and JavaScript), including the Web SSH service, the Authentication Service, and the API Gateway, as well as integrated with other microservices. Non-technically, I contributed towards the project management of Virtuoso to organize tasks, consider task dependencies, and ensure tasks were on track.

From my initial assessment last Fall, I applied my back-end software engineering skills in helping the build the various microservices, including Node.js, Python, MongoDB, and Docker, as well as designing back-end APIs and working with data. Through this project, I learned about the proper way to design architectures for applications, how to solve problems with microservices, and how to implement independent microservices that work together to perform a specific task. The competencies I built for myself in the project included knowing how to go about building well-planned and well-structured applications and knowing how and when to make decisions when planning and building complex software. My successes in the project included designing and building out various independent microservices for Virtuoso that work together, as well as leading project management for the development of Virtuoso. My obstacles included learning how to simulate interaction with code and microservices that haven’t yet been written, but will exist in the future, as well as learning how to go about testing microservices that were written independently, but should work together to accomplish a shared task.
