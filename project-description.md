### Project Problem Statement

> Primary school educators want to teach networking and security fundamentals to students in their classrooms. However, there is no practical way to emulate networks and their interactions.

### Project Background Description

Teachers would currently need to use virtual box or other VM software. These tools have a large capital investment, resource allocation issue, and a large learning curve to basic literacy. These issues are prohibitive to teaching using local hardware. An alternative could be to use cloud VMs from cloud provides like AWS. This is not feasible for a classroom scale due to the cost of running multiple VMs small scale computing. 


### Inadequacy of Current Solutions

Limited solution exist today that are easily accessible to educators. Current tooling is uses outdated technology, highly complex user interfaces, and non-web based solutions.

### Background Skills and Interest

- UI/UX Design Tooling
  - React
  - Figma
- Modern API Design
  - GraphQL 
  - RESTful
- Security

### Problem Approach

We will create a unified web-based user interface that allows teachers and students to manage virtual networks. The back-end will run on commodity hardware commonly available to schools using containerization for nodes. We will design an API to connect these systems and utilizes an orchestration system to manage the containers.
